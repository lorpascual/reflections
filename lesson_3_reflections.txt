When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm part of a development team and I need to share my changes to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When you pull changes you are aware of what are you exactly pulling and when you want to do it. However you take
the risk of forget to pull and important change and later have to make a huge pull.
