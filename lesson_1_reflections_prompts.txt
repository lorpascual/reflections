How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Using diff is easier to find bugs because you can focus only on the lines that have differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
With the history of a file you can be aware of all the changes the file has had in the time and roll back
any change that you don't need.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: You decide the moment and the size for the commit according your judgment.
Cons: You can forget to commit important changes and the commit can be too big later.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git allow multiple files commit because you can be working y several related files at the same time so you need
to keep control of the changes all the files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log you can see all the changes on the file and with diff you can compare between diffenrents commits.
